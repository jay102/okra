# Notes

For the first task, i used about 30 - 40mins to prepare the dashboard layout and design with CSS Grid and the responsiveness, i went ahead to load in the recommendations-michael csv data with D3, and then loaded into an interactive table.
With more time, paginating the data on this table would be ideal, to mitigate this, i reduced the font sizes to be be visually apealling and not intimidating.

For the second task, i installed a package, react-chart-js which comes with a suite of data visualization components which includes, Line graphs, Bar chats, etc
I loaded in the sales-michael.csv using d3, formatted the data to suit the line graph and plotted the michael sales and predicted sales against the quarter.

With more Time, i would use the same technique used in loading the previous csv files to load in the regional-sales.csv,adherence-michael.csv,market-share.csv files and plot a combination of bar, line, scatter charts etc

In summary, it was fun to work on, albeit i would have achieved more with time , but i thorolghly enjoyed working on this making visualizations out of the csv files received.
